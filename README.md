# Automated Plant Monitoring and Irrigation System
Arduino based plant monitor

## Functionality
Arduino program monitor the temperature, moisture, and light of a plant and display the readings to the user. The readings are taken once at startup and then periodically every set interval of time. During low light conditions the grow light will on taking into account the amount of light required for the plant per day.

## Requirements
* Arduino UNO
* LM35 temperature sensor
* Light sensor(photo resistor)
* Relay for the light bulb
* Solenoid valve
